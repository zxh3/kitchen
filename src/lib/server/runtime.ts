/**
 * The kitchen sandbox runtime: what turns a bare base image into a sandbox
 * with working zsh / herdr / vscode / browser panes.
 *
 * Persistence is NOT wired up here. A sandbox is its filesystem, and snapshots
 * (see server/snapshots.ts) capture that filesystem whole — so tools
 * live where tools normally live, and anything installed anywhere survives.
 * Volumes are a user-visible option, never a runtime mechanism.
 *
 * Two halves:
 *  - `runtimeCommands` — image layers appended to every base image. Modal
 *    caches built images by layer content, so keep these deterministic
 *    (pinned versions) or every sandbox launch pays a rebuild.
 *  - `bootScript` — the sandbox entrypoint, passed as the create command.
 *    It carries no secrets in the image: the per-sandbox auth secret arrives
 *    via the KITCHEN_SECRET env var at launch. If any service dies, the
 *    script exits nonzero so the status reconciler reports the sandbox as
 *    failed.
 *
 * Auth model: Caddy owns the public tunnel ports and fronts every service
 * (which bind to localhost only). The console points each pane's iframe at
 * /kitchen-auth?token=<secret>; Caddy answers with an HttpOnly cookie and a
 * redirect, and everything after that — including WebSockets — must carry
 * the cookie. No long-lived secret sits in a URL.

// ttyd's last release (1.7.7, 2024) predates xterm.js's clipboard addon, so
// OSC 52 copies — how herdr's copy-on-select reaches the browser clipboard —
// were silently dropped. Master bundles the addon and commits a prebuilt web
// UI (src/html.h), so it builds from source with cmake alone. Pinned commit.
const TTYD_COMMIT = "2922cb89f518bae4d0fcf4d757a7419638fc71fc";

/**
 * Bump when `runtimeCommands` changes in a way an existing sandbox would care
 * about (new binary versions, new preinstalled tooling). Snapshots record
 * it, so the UI can tell that a restored sandbox is on an older runtime and
 * offer to rebuild. The boot script is passed at create time, so changes there
 * need no bump — they apply on the next start.
 *
 * Mirrored in $lib/runtimeVersion.ts for the client; keep the two in step.
