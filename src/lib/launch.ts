/**
 * Launching a sandbox, from the browser's side.

 * Creation is slow enough (a first-time image build runs minutes) that it
 * cannot block a dialog or a button. So the caller fires this and forgets: the
 * row is recorded as "creating" in the sandbox store immediately, phases
 * stream in from the server, and the outcome lands in the store either way.
 *
 * The awkward case is a launch whose connection dies mid-build — a real thing
 * on long gRPC image builds behind proxies. The sandbox may well come up
 * anyway, so instead of reporting failure we poll the list for the name before
 * deciding. Retrying is safe regardless: cached layers make a rebuild quick,
 * and the name is the state identity, so a second attempt resumes the same
 * /workspace.
